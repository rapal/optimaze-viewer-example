# optimaze-viewer-example

This is an example application for the [`optimaze-viewer`](https://github.com/rapal/optimaze-viewer) library. It loads data from the [Optimaze API](https://portal.optimaze.net/apidocs) using the OAuth 2 authorization code flow for authenticating API requests. An Optimaze account is required in order to log in. The application is written in TypeScript and uses Webpack for bundling.

If you are interested in creating a third-party application using Optimaze floor plans, please contact [support@optimaze.net](mailto:support@optimaze.net).
